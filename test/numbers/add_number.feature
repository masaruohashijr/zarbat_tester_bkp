Feature: Add Number    
  In order to add a new number
  As an end user
  I want to list at least one number and add a new number
  And list again and see the added number inside the list

  Scenario: List available numbers and buy one

    Given my test setup runs    
    When I list all available numbers
    Then I should get to buy 1 from list
